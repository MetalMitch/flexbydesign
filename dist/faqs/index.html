            <h3>What is Flexible Work?</h3>
            <p>
              The business dictionary defines flexible work as “Work practice
              that allows the employees a certain degree of freedom in deciding
              how the work will be done and how they'll coordinate their
              schedules with those of other employees.”
            </p>
            <p>
              To us, it’s so much more. Flexible work is any arrangement that
              increase flexibility options by:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Empowering workers self-management to improve team productivity
              </li>
              <li>
                Allowing mitigation of environmental impact at the company or
                individual level
              </li>
              <li>Allowing personal work-life balance through choice</li>
              <li>
                Improving the chance of equality by removing social barriers
              </li>
              <li>
                Allowing more people to work with and around personal limiting
                circumstances
              </li>
              <li>
                Streamlining bureaucracy without removing accountability for
                work responsibilities
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Flexible work is the future of work.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <h3>How are most companies organising flexibility?</h3>
            <p>
              Inefficiently… or not at all.
            </p>
            <p>
              55% of companies that could easily accommodate basic flexible work
              solutions do not have any formal policy on flexibility. This
              reduces the visibility of impact since there are no formal
              measurements or targets and possible options are not transparently
              available to employees reducing uptake.
            </p>
            <p>
              Research suggests options, outside of flexible hours or days and
              work from home, are often unknown and underutilised.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <h3>
              We have a flexible work policy, why do we need a flexible work
              strategy?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Policy without action is invisible and options without policy are
              inefficient and hard to quantify. Flexible work needs to be
              defined, measured, carefully considered and updated in the same
              way any every other business strategy would be, to be effective in
              the long term.
            </p>
            <p>
              A short term unchecked policy can undermine long term strategy
              producing unintended and undesired consequences. In that way,
              flexible work is no different, it can impact every aspect of a
              business and silently grow (or undermine) a company.
            </p>
            <p>Can you afford to give away that competitive edge?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <h3>
              Why can’t companies just create their own flexible work policies
              and strategies?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Most companies now have a flexible work policy. It generally sits
              somewhere on the HR intranet and is often so full of conditions it
              is far from flexible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Corporations are starting to realise they need to develop
              workplace strategies and space efficiency initiatives to
              future-proof work environments, attract and retain personnel, and
              mitigate disruption.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <h3>What support does Flex By Design offer?</h3>
            <p>
              Flex by design aims to offer a holistic approach to flexible work
              via web and mobile-enabled platform. To design, manage and update
              a flexible work strategy to maximise the benefit for the company,
              employee and customer.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div id="right">
          <div class="question">
            <h3>Who wants flexible work options?</h3>
            <p>
              Everyone… nearly.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2012 60% of knowledge-based workers expected to work flexibly,
              in 2019, that percentage increased to 75%. When asked, 84% of
              employees would like to have flexible options when they work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Younger generations see flexibility as a need for life balance and
              autonomy and older generations want the flexibility to accommodate
              a gradual shift towards retirement on their own terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everybody benefits from more choice to prioritise day to day needs
              without sacrificing home or work commitments.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <h3>How are most companies supporting flexible work?</h3>
            <p>
              In short, they are not sure. Most flexible arrangements are
              informal agreements between managers and staff leaving them open
              to abuse and miss-use on both sides. 45% of companies with
              official flexible work policy are not currently offering tools to
              support staff with the uptake of flexible work arrangements
              leaving the success of arrangements up to the individual and team.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <h3>How much can we save with flexible work strategy?</h3>
            <p>That depends on many factors, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Current overheads from rent and running of central office space
              </li>
              <li>Lost time from travel and commuting disruptions</li>
              <li>Staff turnover and recruitment costs</li>
              <li>Lost productivity from lowered staff wellbeing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              After profiling, analysis and a strategy development pilot Flex By
              Design will be able to provide a detailed clear indication of
              potential cost savings in the long term.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <h3>
              Why is a flexible work strategy more cost-effective than just
              hot-desking and allowing working from home?
            </h3>
            <p>
              While many larger organisations have turned to hot-desking and
              agile work arrangements, all too often they are perceived as cost
              cutting initiatives with a one-size fits all approach. This
              results in unintended consequences where those working entirely
              from home start to feel isolated, introverts forced to hotdesk can
              become anxious and teams can become disconnected.
            </p>
            <p>Flex By Design mitigates these issues in three key ways:</p>
            <ul id="flexwork">
              <li>
                <h4>Profiling:</h4>
                <p>
                  Individuals are assessed to determine their workspace needs
                  both in terms of their role, productivity preferences and
                  personal situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is reviewed against the Company objectives and needs to
                  ensure a holistic approach that benefits all.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Co-working:</h4>
                <p>
                  The Flex By Design platform connects companies to a network of
                  independent geographically diverse co-working spaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These shared work spaces have been shown to reduce isolation
                  while providing employees with the benefits of access to a
                  more diverse community and exposure to innovative ideas.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Technology:</h4>
                <p>
                  Flex By Design’s tech-enabled solution, allows managing
                  flexible arrangements to be clear, transparent and easy.
